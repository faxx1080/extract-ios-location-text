# Quick Scripting - iOS Location Extractor

In iOS Photos.sqlite, there is a table ZADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES with field "ZREVERSELOCATIONDATA". In
https://github.com/ScottKjr3347/iOS_Local_PL_Photos.sqlite_Queries it is represented as
"zAddAssetAttr-Reverse Location Data/Orig-Asset/HEX NSKeyed Plist" in the Basic Join.

This is actually an embedded bplist file. We can convert this to a readable dictionary using either the Notepad++ bplist plugin,
or more efficiently using a Java library.

The process is:

1) Dump your Photos.sqlite file somewhere on disk
2) Optionally: Use DBeaver to export a filtered list of the Basic SQL with null columns removed to a separate SQLITE file
3) Build the Java project (basic gradle build): ./gradlew uberJar
4) Run the build/libs/JavaBplistConv-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file: `java -jar JavaBplistConv-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <dbFile> <outFile>`
5) Trim the last \r\n or \n from the resulting text file manually

This extracts the data.

To import the data, in DBeaver:

1) Import the Text file into a table (to be deleted later). Make sure you set the field delimiter to something like ยง which is reasonably sure
not to be an actual location
2) run the following query:

```sql
select z.rowid,z.*,l.LOCATION  from ZASSET z
inner join Location l on l.rowid = z.rowid
```

Export that result into a new table.
